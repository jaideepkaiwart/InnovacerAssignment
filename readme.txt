How to run the code:

1. Save the file "Deduplication Problem - Sample Dataset.csv" in the same folder which contains "code.py".
2. Run the code twice. In the first run, it creates output file "output.csv". In the next run it writes to this file.

Output Format: 

The format of the output is the same as the input. First column contains last name, second column contains date of birth, third 
column contains gender and the last column contains first name.

The output file contains less number of rows than the input file, because the code removes duplicates of records. Hence every entry 
in the output file is a information about unique person.
